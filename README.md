# VTL
**Note**: For experimental verification, we developed a video tracking instrument that can simultaneously track the movements of each fly in a group for days.

## Requirements

The main requirements are listed below:

* Python 3.8
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Skimage
* Matplotlib
* Numba

## The description of VTL source codes

* vtl.py

    The code is used for videos transforming into a data point in a two-dimensional coordinate system.

* dataorder.py

    The code is used for raw wo-dimensional coordinate system data ordering.
